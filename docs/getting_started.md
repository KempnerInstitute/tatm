# Getting Started

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.10 is the minimum supported version. 

- `tatm` depends on pytorch, which depends on CUDA. It is recommended to pre-install both pytorch and CUDA prior to installing `tatm`. Instructions for installing pytorch can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

### Installation

#### Installing from GitHub

To install the latest stable version of `tatm` from GitHub, run the following command:

```bash
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/KempnerInstitute/tatm.git@main
```

To install the latest development version of `tatm` from GitHub, run the following command:

```bash
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/KempnerInstitute/tatm.git@dev
```

For a specific past version of `tatm`, replace `main` or `dev` with the desired version number (i.e. `v0.1.0`).

#### Installing from PyPI

The package is not yet available on PyPI. Stay tuned for updates!
